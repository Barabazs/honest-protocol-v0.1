# Notes
## Bitlogic
## labelIndices behavior
will return 0 for both the first index and the labels that don't exist. you must 
## editLabel with a label name that doesn't exist yet 
Current behavior: it will automatically add that label. However, this means that a label name with an accidental typo will be added. 
## Do we want to be consistent about providing multiple functions for allowing both string and index form label as parameter
